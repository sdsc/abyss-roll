This roll source supports building for different network fabrics and mpi
flavors.  By default, it builds using the gnu compilers for openmpi ethernet.
To build for a different configuration, use the ROLLMPI and ROLLNETWORK make
variables, e.g.,

make ROLLMPI=mpich2 ROLLNETWORK=mx 

The build process currently supports ROLLMPI values "openmpi", "mpich2", and
"mvapich2", defaulting to "openmpi".  It uses any ROLLNETWORK variable value(s)
to load appropriate mpi modules, assuming that there are modules named
$(ROLLMPI)_$(ROLLNETWORK) available (e.g., openmpi_ib, mpich2_mx, etc.).

If the ROLLNETWORK and/or ROLLMPI variables are specified, their values are
incorporated into the names of the produced roll and rpms, e.g.,

make ROLLMPI=mvapich2 ROLLNETWORK=ib

produces a roll with a name that begins "abyss_mvapich2_ib"; it contains and
installs similarly-named rpms.
