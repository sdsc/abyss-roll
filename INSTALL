This roll bundles the ABYSS sequence assembler.  To build, execute

% make

in this directory.  In addition to the software itself, the roll installs
ABYSS environment module files in /opt/modulefiles/applications/abyss.

This roll source supports building for different network fabrics and mpi
flavors.  By default, it builds using the gnu compilers for openmpi ethernet.
To build for a different configuration, use the ROLLMPI and ROLLNETWORK make
variables, e.g.,

% make ROLLMPI=mpich2 ROLLNETWORK=mx 

The build process currently supports ROLLMPI values "openmpi", "mpich2", and
"mvapich2", defaulting to "openmpi".  It uses any ROLLNETWORK variable value(s)
to load appropriate mpi modules, assuming that there are modules named
$(ROLLMPI)_$(ROLLNETWORK) available (e.g., openmpi_ib, mpich2_mx, etc.).
